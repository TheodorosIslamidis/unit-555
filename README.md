# üîÆ Mana & Bonus Spell Calculator

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://unit-555.streamlit.app/)

A simple yet powerful Streamlit web application designed for tabletop RPG players to calculate bonus spells or a mana pool based on their character's ability scores. This tool is primarily based on the rules found in **Dungeons & Dragons 3.5e** and **Pathfinder 1e**, with flexible options for homebrew systems.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Dual System Calculation**: Choose between two different calculation methods:
  - **D&D 3.5e / Pathfinder**: Displays the number of bonus spell slots gained for each spell level (1-9).
  - **Final Fantasy Mana System**: Calculates a total mana pool where each bonus spell slot contributes its spell level to the total (e.g., a 3rd-level slot is worth 3 mana).
- **Epic & Divine Spell Support**: Includes an option for characters with feats like "Divine Spellcasting," extending the calculation to support spell levels from 10th to 25th.
- **Uncapped Ability Scores**: Enter any ability score, no matter how high, to support epic-level and mythic characters.
- **Clean & Interactive UI**: A straightforward and easy-to-use interface built with Streamlit.
- **Detailed Breakdown**: For the mana system, the app provides a clear table showing how the total mana pool is calculated from the bonus spell slots.
